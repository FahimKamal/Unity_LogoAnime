# Unity Logo Animation
I created this animation for one of the games that I have worked on `Zen Farm` (code name). To 
create this I had to utilize both programming and `*.anim` files. But the end result is satisfying.  
## Features
- Re-arrange the order and placement of the letters as needed. 
- Use any 3D object for each of the letters.
- Color changing animation can be modified as well. you can add as many color as you need.
